                        <h4>Liability Insurance</h4>
                        <p>
                            Just like with car insurance, liability insurance for scooters covers bodily injury and property damage you cause to others and keeps you street legal.

                        <h4>Collision Coverage</h4>
                        <p>
                            This coverage pays for repairs or replacement of your scooter if it's damaged in an accident with another vehicle or object.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Comprehensive Coverage</h4>
                        <p>
                            Comprehensive coverage protects your scooter against non-collision incidents such as theft, vandalism, fire, or natural disasters.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Liability Insurance</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you're involved in an accident with a driver who doesn’t hold insurance or enough coverage, this helps recover costs for injuries, medical expenses and damages to your scooter.

                            Also known as personal injury protection (PIP), this covers costs associated with injuries for you and your passengers—regardless of who’s at fault.
                        </p>

                            If you’ve added custom accessories or modifications to your scooter, accessory coverage helps repair or replace them if damaged or stolen.
