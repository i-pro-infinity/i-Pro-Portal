                            Just like with car insurance, liability insurance for scooters covers bodily injury and property damage you cause to others and keeps you street legal.

                            If you're involved in an accident with a driver who doesn’t hold insurance or enough coverage, this helps recover costs for injuries, medical expenses and damages to your scooter.
