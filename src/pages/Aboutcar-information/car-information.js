                          New Vehicle Insurance Policy is a specialized insurance coverage designed for brand-new cars.
                          It offers comprehensive protection against various risks and damages that may occur during
                          the initial period of owning a new vehicle.

                      <p>
                          One of the major differences in this policy is that it provides a three-year third party premium
                          and a one-year own-damage (OD) premium. This means that the third-party coverage remains valid
                          for three years, ensuring extended protection against third-party liabilities, while the own damage
                          coverage is for one year.
